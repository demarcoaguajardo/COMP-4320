# Programming Assignment 02 â€“ TCP Client-Server
Unfortunately, there is no outline for this assignment as I was unable to access it once the semester ended.  

## Sumary  
In a nutshell, the ClientTCP.java file is a Java-based TCP client that communicates with a server to send requests
and in-turn receive responses. It prompts the user for an operator code and two operands, then encodes the request
and sends it to the server over a TCP connection. The client waits for the server's response, decodes it, and displays
the response in hexadecimal format along with the elapsed time.
